### What is a binary search tree ?

* The main use BST is for searching.
* We impose a restriction on the kind of data a node can contain.
* So it reduces the worst case search to O(log base2 n) unlike O(n) in trees.

### Properties of a binary search tree ?

* The nodes on the left of the current node should contain values less than the current node.
* The nodes on the right of the current node should contain values greater than the current node.
* The left and right subtrees must be binary search trees.
* Inorder traversal on BST gives the elements of the tree in the increasing order.Inorder traverses in `left->root->right` manner and as we know the property that root is greater than left and smaller than right so it gives all the elements in incresing order. 

### Binary Search tree declaration

```struct BinarySearchNode {
	int data;
	struct BinarySearchNode *left;
	struct BinarySearchNode *right;
}```
