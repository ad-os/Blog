A few days ago I read a post on javascript closures so I thought to share what I have read on it(Inspired by a post from [interviewcake][interviewcake].
<br><br>
Analyze the example given below first.
<br>
Do predict your result before clicking on one of the button given below.

<pre>&lt;button id="btn-0"&gt;Button 1!&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id="btn-1"&gt;Button 2!&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id="btn-2"&gt;Button 3!&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
	var prizes = ['A Unicorn!', 'A Hug!', 'Fresh Laundry!'];
	for (var btnNum = 0; btnNum &lt; prizes.length; btnNum++) {
		// for each of our buttons, when the user clicks it...
		document.getElementById('btn-' + btnNum).onclick = function() {
			// tell her what she's won!
			alert(prizes[btnNum]);
		};
	}
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<button id="btnp-0">Button 1!</button>
<button id="btnp-1">Button 2!</button>
<button id="btnp-2">Button 3!</button>

<script type="text/javascript">
	var prizes = ['A Unicorn!', 'A Hug!', 'Fresh Laundry!'];
	for (var btnNum = 0; btnNum < prizes.length; btnNum++) {
		// for each of our buttons, when the user clicks it...
		document.getElementById('btnp-' + btnNum).onclick = function() {
			// tell her what she's won!
			alert(prizes[btnNum]);
		};
	};
</script>

Clicking on the each of the button would not led to expected result for some of you. If you guessed it right then this article is not for you ;)
<br><br>
Those who are just getting started to hang out with js would expect the output to be 0, 1 and 2 respectively for each of the button when clicked.
<br><br>
But that is not the case ;)
<br>
The syntax of the code is right but there is a problem with the behaviour.
<br>

###Problem

The anonymous function(onclick in this case) which we are assigning to each button has access to a variable outside the scope of it(this is called as closure).In this case it has access to btnNum.

###Closure

A closure is a function has access to a variable outside of it's scope.
<br>
For e.g
<pre>var message = "Hey!"
function sayMessage() {
	alert(message); // we have access to message variable.
}</pre>
Here we would say that variable message is closed over by sayMessage().
<br>
Now moving back to the example :)
<br>
`When a function accesses a variable outside of it's scope it gets the current value not the frozen value` i.e when our loop would have parsed the btnNum would contain the value of 3.
<br>
Therefore accessing the third element in the array would return a `undefined` because the we have only three accessible indices in our array i.e 0,1 and 2.So our alert box shows `undefined` when each of the button is clicked.
<br>
Now you know why the problem arised and we now need to figure out the solution to the problem.
<br>

###The Solution

We can solve this problem by wrapping our anonymous function in another anonymous which takes btnNum as a arguement.
<br>
Like this!
<pre>&lt;button id="btn-0"&gt;Button 1!&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id="btn-1"&gt;Button 2!&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id="btn-2"&gt;Button 3!&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
	var prizes = ['A Unicorn!', 'A Hug!', 'Fresh Laundry!'];
	for (var btnNum = 0; btnNum &lt; prizes.length; btnNum++) {
		// for each of our buttons, when the user clicks it...
		document.getElementById('btn-' + btnNum).onclick = function(btnNum) {
			// tell her what she's won!
			return function() {
				alert(prizes[btnNum]);
			};
		}(btnNum);
	}
&lt;/script&gt;</pre> 
<button id="btn-0">Button 1!</button>
<button id="btn-1">Button 2!</button>
<button id="btn-2">Button 3!</button>

<script type="text/javascript">
	var prizes = ['A Unicorn!', 'A Hug!', 'Fresh Laundry!'];
	for (var btnNum = 0; btnNum < prizes.length; btnNum++) {
		// for each of our buttons, when the user clicks it...
		document.getElementById('btn-' + btnNum).onclick = function(btnNum) {
			// tell her what she's won!
			return function() {
				alert(prizes[btnNum]);
			}
		}(btnNum);
	};
</script>
`Why the above solution is correct?`


Each of the button has access to the frozen value of the btnNum because the outer anonymous calls the inner anonymous function and it returns a function which contains a alertbox for the current value of btnNum and this returned function is called when the button is clicked.
