## What is angular ?
* A client-side javascript framework for adding interactivity to HTML.
* In angular we add interactivity to HTML using directives.

## Why do we need to use angular ?
* Angular makes our web page responsive.
* In a traditional web page i.e non responsive whenever we click on a link all the assests are requested again and then rendered.
* In responsive web page when a link is clicked a response with json data is obtained and data is loaded into the existing page.

## What are directives ?
* A directive is a marker on a HTML tag that tells Angular to run or reference some javascript code. 

## What are modules ?
* Modules are where we write pieces of angular application.
* Modules make our code testable, maintainable and readable.
* Where we define dependencies of our app.
For e.g
```
var app = angular.module('store', []);
// store - name of the applcation.
// [] - contains the name of the dependencies
```

## What are expressions ?
* Allows you to insert dynamic values into the HTML.
For e.g
```
<p>
  I am {{4+6}}
  //{{4+6}} is a expression.
</p>
```

## What are controllers ?
* Thay help us to get the data on to the page.
