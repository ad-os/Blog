### Is javascript a compiled or interpreted language ?
JavaScript is an interpreted language, with optional JIT-compilation support. In older implementations (e.g. Internet Exlorer 8 and earlier, Firefox prior to 3.5), JavaScript was a purely interpreted language. This means that scripts execute without preliminary compilation, i.e. without conversion of the script text into system-dependent machine code. The user's browser interprets the script, that is, analyzes and immediately executes it. In modern implementations, JavaScript code may be either interpreted or compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. At run time, the browser decides whether (parts of) script code should be JIT-compiled for better performance. This makes JavaScript significantly faster and therefore more suitable for complex performance-demanding Web applications. Recent versions of all popular browsers have JavaScript JIT-compilers.

Will continue this ;)
